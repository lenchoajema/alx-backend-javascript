# JavaScript Classes and Metaprogramming

## Introduction
This project is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of JavaScript classes and metaprogramming. It covers how to define and extend classes, add methods (including static methods), and introduces metaprogramming concepts using symbols.

## How to Define a Class
In JavaScript, a class is defined using the `class` keyword. A class can have a constructor method that initializes the object.

**Example:**

class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}


## How to Add Methods to a Class
Methods are functions that belong to a class. You can add methods inside the class definition.

**Example:**

class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
  }
}

const person1 = new Person('Alice', 30);
console.log(person1.greet()); // Logs: Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old.


## Why and How to Add a Static Method to a Class
Static methods are called on the class itself, not on instances of the class. They are useful for utility functions that pertain to the class but not to any specific instance.

**Example:**

class Calculator {
  static add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

console.log(Calculator.add(5, 3)); // Logs: 8


## How to Extend a Class from Another
You can create a new class that inherits properties and methods from an existing class using the `extends` keyword.

**Example:**

class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name); // Calls the constructor of the parent class
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
  }
}

const dog = new Dog('Buddy', 'Golden Retriever');
dog.speak(); // Logs: Buddy barks.


## Metaprogramming and Symbols
Metaprogramming is a programming technique where programs have the ability to treat other programs as their data. In JavaScript, symbols are often used in metaprogramming.

### Symbols
Symbols are unique and immutable data types that can be used as identifiers for object properties.

**Example:**

const sym = Symbol('description');

class MyClass {
  constructor() {
    this[sym] = 'Symbolic property';
  }

  getSym() {
    return this[sym];
  }
}

const myInstance = new MyClass();
console.log(myInstance.getSym()); // Logs: Symbolic property


Symbols are often used for defining non-enumerable properties or for implementing private properties in classes.

## Conclusion
This project covers the essentials of working with classes in JavaScript, including defining and extending classes, adding methods, and using static methods. Additionally, it introduces metaprogramming concepts using symbols, which can be powerful tools in advanced JavaScript programming. Explore the code examples and documentation to deepen your understanding and mastery of these topics.
