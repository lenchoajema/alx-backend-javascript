# ES6 Overview and Features

## Introduction
Welcome to the **ES6 Overview and Features** project. This repository is designed to provide a thorough understanding of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), the sixth edition of the ECMAScript language specification standard. ES6 introduced several new features that enhance JavaScript's readability, efficiency, and flexibility.

## What is ES6?
ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is a significant update to JavaScript that brings a variety of new features and improvements. It aims to provide better syntax for complex applications and make JavaScript a more powerful and expressive language.

## New Features Introduced in ES6
- **Arrow Functions**: Provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions.
- **Block-Scoped Variables**: Introduce `let` and `const` keywords for block-scoped variable declarations.
- **Classes**: Introduce a clean syntax for defining classes and inheritance.
- **Template Literals**: Allow embedding expressions within strings for easier string interpolation.
- **Destructuring Assignment**: Simplifies extracting values from arrays or objects into distinct variables.
- **Default Parameters**: Enable setting default values for function parameters.
- **Rest and Spread Operators**: Facilitate handling of function parameters and array elements.
- **Promises**: Provide a way to handle asynchronous operations more gracefully.
- **Modules**: Introduce import and export statements for better modularity.
- **Iterators and Generators**: Facilitate custom iteration and asynchronous flow control.

## Difference Between a Constant and a Variable
- **Constant (`const`)**: Represents a variable whose value cannot be reassigned once it is set. It is block-scoped.
- **Variable (`let` and `var`)**: Variables declared with `let` are block-scoped, whereas variables declared with `var` are function-scoped. Variables can be reassigned new values.

## Block-Scoped Variables
- **`let` and `const`**: Introduce block-level scoping, which means that the variables are only accessible within the block they are declared in. This helps prevent issues with variable hoisting and reduces errors in code.

## Arrow Functions and Function Parameters Default to Them
- **Arrow Functions**: Provide a shorter syntax for writing functions using the `=>` symbol. They inherit the `this` context from their parent scope.
  
  const add = (a, b) => a + b;
  
- **Default Parameters**: Allow you to specify default values for function parameters if no value or `undefined` is passed.
  
  function greet(name = 'Guest') {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  }
  

## Rest and Spread Function Parameters
- **Rest Parameters**: Allow you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.
  
  function sum(...numbers) {
    return numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
  }
  
- **Spread Operator**: Allows an iterable (like an array) to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments or elements are expected.
  
  const arr = [1, 2, 3];
  const newArr = [...arr, 4, 5];
  

## String Templating in ES6
- **Template Literals**: Allow embedding expressions within strings using backticks (`) and `${}` syntax.
  
  const name = 'Lencho';
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  

## Object Creation and Their Properties in ES6
- **Enhanced Object Literals**: Simplify the process of creating objects and assigning properties.
  
  const name = 'Lencho';
  const user = {
    name,
    greet() {
      console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
    }
  };
  

## Iterators and `for-of` Loops
- **Iterators**: Provide a way to iterate over collections like arrays, strings, and more.
  
  const iterator = arr[Symbol.iterator]();
  console.log(iterator.next().value); // 1
  
- **`for-of` Loop**: Simplifies iterating over iterable objects.
  
  for (const value of arr) {
    console.log(value);
  }
